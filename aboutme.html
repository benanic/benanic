								<p>I am a South Carolina Gamecock alum who studied Finance with a concentration in Business Analytics. After graduating in 2021, I began working for a multi-national construction company called Skanska as a Data Analyst intern. Upon completion of my internship, I earned a full-time offer and have since developed many national reports that are used by various departments across the company. Since starting in this role, I have gained a breadth of experience with Power BI, Power Apps, Paginated Report Builder, and SQL.</p>
								<p>I am a dedicated individual and I take pride in what I do. Throughout University I had aspirations of becoming a financial analyst, but in my junior year, I took an introductory course on Power BI which opened me up to the world of data. I have since earned two Microsoft certifications in Azure Fundamentals and as a Data Analyst Associate, which have furthered my skills and expertise in the Azure environment as well as data analysis and visualization development.</p>
								<p>In my free time, I enjoy watching various shows, trying new restaurants, and exploring new areas with my significant other. I also love to learn! I enjoy learning technical subjects like data science, programming, economics and more through various mediums like blogs, podcasts, and books.</p>
